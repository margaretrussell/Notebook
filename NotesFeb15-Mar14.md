Mostly what I got out of this lecture and its readings is that video games can be a great learning tool because of their process of 
immersing the player into the past and by playing through the past it can be presented in a way that shows its contingency on decisions that
are being made in the present through the player. The only problem that I see with this, as I'm sure many people do, is that video games can
often be played uncritically and accepted at face value. Now I'm not a video game player myself, so I may be looking at this very short-sightedly
but whenever I have play, I've often looked only at the objective of whatever I was playing, not the motivations for the game set up to be
a certain way. That might just be me however.

I mostly just remember Kurt arguing about graphics not mattering... And while I think he has a valid point about the small scale aesthetic
choices game makers use, I almost have no opinion if it doesn't interfere with playibility. The only two games I can really reflect on from
personal experience is the making of our own game for module 3, and then from the player's persepective in the sims 2, 3, and 4. Again, I
have very limited experience with video games so this might just be me. 

 In terms of our own game, I would have preferred to spend time on making our narrative better and more entertaining, than beautifying it.
 I do understand it's imporance though because I only play "ugly games" now for nostaligia. An example of this is if I were to play the sims
 2 or 3. While the graphics qualities are poor comparible to the sims 4, I actually prefer their playibility but that is from comfort and a
 general unwillingness to learn a new way to play a familiar game. 
 
 Another interesting concept brought up was the cinematic experience of playing video games which is something I'm a lot more familiar with.
 Because I'm not video game inclined, they never really interested me for whatever, I have spent a lot of time watching friends, family, and
 others playing video games. To me, video games are a cinematic experience because I am only paying attention to the storyline without actually
 trying to participate as a player. This leads to some interesting things, like figuring out puzzles or how to do certain things in the game
 before whoever was playing figures it out but mostly it means that I only watch video games I enjoy the storyline to. A lot of self-professed
 gamers have a really bad definition of good storylines because of the over-saturation of first person shooters. If any video game has a 
 story that is more than "shoot these guys" it tends to be highly overrated because of the "beautiful storyline" that's deep or whatever.
 It's mostly just sad that video games seem to have some sort of divide of mulimedia experience between makers, players, and those who watch
 them.

Other lectures were Twine exercises!
