I don't have a lot to say on these readings. Regrettably I didn't think about much of them further than whatever was necessary for our module
4 and even then it seemed very straight forward and my commentary style didn't have much to add. Although the stuff on VR and AR was very interesting
I don't think I have any technical know-how to help forward the discussion because I really just don't know where the limits are on this and
if of my thoughts on it would be possible. I'd like for there maybe be some sort of video on how to get into doing VR and AR just because I'm 
so inexperienced with it. It's really cool and the possibilities seem endless but it's not something I'm particularly focused in learning 
because it seems so daunting at this point.

The articles about colonialism were certainly helpful when writing the paradata for module 4 especially with regards to how our object was originally 
Ancient Egyptian and is now in a Western Museum and restored to how it was originally, not how it was found.
